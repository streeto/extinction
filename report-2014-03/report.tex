\title{Report on dust lane studies}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

As you may or may not know, we are trying to measure the extinction law of dust
lanes in front of some CALIFA galaxies. We developed a method to estimate the
intrinsic spectra, behind the dust lane, and then compute directly $A_\lambda$
for each pixel comparing them to the observed ``dusty'' spectra. So far we have
applied the method to K0708 (Figure \ref{fig:sdssK0708}) and K0925 (Figure
\ref{fig:sdssK0925}), using the cubes from pipeline 1.3c (processed by \qbick
0.3.6) with no binning, that is, analysing all the spaxel by spaxel. We also use
cubes from pipelines 1.3c and 1.4 (processed by \qbick 0.4.2), using Voronoi
binning for $S/N \geq 20$. All the spectra were \starlight-ed using the base
Granada, a combination of models from \citet{Vazdekis2010} for ages older than
$63\,Myr$ and from \citet{GonzalezDelgado2005} for younger ages (hereafter
\gsd). We were inspired by the work done by \citet{Holwerda2013}, who use HST
and CALIFA data. Also worth mentioning is the paper by \citet{Wild2011}, which
uses photometry and pairs of SDSS galaxies.

These are our preliminary results.


\section{Selecting the dust lane}

The first issue we should address is how to decide which pixels belong to the
dust lane, and which ones do not. Our first try was to select pixels where the
$A_V$ from \starlight is over a given threshold. This seems a circular argument,
but we had to start somewhere. The problem here lies in the
age--metallicity--dust degeneracy, so that pixels with high $A_V$ may be false
positives (or, conversely, low $A_V$ false negatives). It also depends on the
particular \starlight run, so we end up having the dust lane defined as
different regions in the various cubes from the same galaxy. This can be
misleading, we need a stronger definition of the dust lane region.

We developed a small software that plots maps of some properties, and allows one
to freely draw polygons over it. Only one map is shown at a time, and the
current map can be selected using the keyboard. The z--scale (\texttt{vmin} and
\texttt{vmax}) can also be changed using the keyboard. Using this tool, the dust
lanes were selected based on the map of flux ratio $F_{6300\,\angstrom} /
F_{4250\,\angstrom}$, which roughly defines a color.
The $A_V$ map was also used in this step as a hint. When there were
discrepancies between color and $A_V$, the color prevailed. These maps are
presented in Figures \ref{fig:mapsK0708} and \ref{fig:mapsK0925}.

\section{Estimating the intrinsic spectra}

Now you are probably thinking, ``how can they expect to know what's
really behind the dust?''. Well, we had to make some
assumptions. First, we have chosen elliptical galaxies. Exploiting the
symmetry of the galaxy, we can try to fill in the flux on the missing
spaxels. Of course, we have to know the geometry of the galaxy.

\subsection{Finding the geometry}
\label{sec:geometry}

If the galaxies are truly elliptical, we can expect to describe them reasonably
well by a ellipse projection with a given $P.A.$ and $b/a$. These parameters
were determined using the flux at $5590$--$5680\,\angstrom$. The algorithm is
the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume initially that $b/a = 1.0, P.A. = 0.0$.
  \item Mask the pixels belonging to the dust lane (gray area in Figures
  \ref{fig:mapsK0708} and \ref{fig:mapsK0925}).
  \item \label{itm:radprof} Calculate the radial profile.
  \item Fill the masked pixels using the radial profile value at the pixel distances.
  \item Calculate P.A. and $b/a$\footnote{We estimate ellipticity and
  orientation of the galaxy using the ``Stokes parameters'', as described by
  Stoughton et al. (2002). See \url{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002AJ....123..485S}}.
  \item Go to item \ref{itm:radprof} until $b/a$ and $P.A.$ converge.
\end{enumerate}

This approach is very simplistic but we believe is enough to provide a good
estimate of the true geometry of the galaxy. We then assume this geometry is the
same at all wavelengths, in the following steps.

\subsection{Kinematics effects}

In the next section we will be taking slices with constant wavelength of the
galaxy 3-D spectra. We compensate the peculiar velocities of each spaxel ($v_0$)
using values previously fitted using \starlight. We also address the velocity
dispersion ($v_d$, also fitted using \starlight) by convolving each spectrum
with a gaussian velocity distribution, such that the final $v_d$ is greater or
equal to a target value, $v_{d,\text{target}}$. The gaussian used in the
convolution has a variance of $v_{d,\text{conv}}$, and is calculated for each
spaxel as \[ v_{d,\text{conv}} = \sqrt{v^2_{d,\text{target}} - v^2_d} \] We
leave the spectra unchanged if $v_d \geq v_{d,\text{target}}$. In this report we
used $v_{d,\text{target}} = 300\,km/s$, a value taken from the hat.

\subsection{Filling the missing spaxels}
\label{sec:filling}

Now we can take slices of the 3-D spectra with constant wavelength, treating
each slice as an image. We then apply the same technique used in Section
\ref{sec:geometry}, that is, for each wavelength, take a slice, mask the dust
lane (the gray area), calculate the radial profile of the flux, and fill the
missing pixels with the the value of the radial profile in its radius. This way,
we have the observed spectra of the pixels on the dust lane, in addition to the
original spectra. By comparing these two spectra, spaxel by spaxel, we can
obtain the map of the extinction.


\section{Calculating and fitting the extinction}
\label{sec:extinction}
Considering a dust screen model, the observed flux is related to the intrinsic
by
\begin{equation}
F^\text{obs}_\lambda = F^\text{intr}_\lambda e^{-\tau_\lambda}.
\end{equation}
Reorganizing to calculate the optical depth,
\begin{equation}
\tau_\lambda = \ln \frac{F^\text{intr}_\lambda}{F^\text{obs}_\lambda}.
\end{equation}
This relates to the extinction by the following:
\begin{equation}
A_\lambda = \frac{\log e}{0.4} \tau_\lambda \approx 1.086 \tau_\lambda
\end{equation}
As a first test, we select a region which seems redder and ``dustier'', marked in
black in Figures \ref{fig:mapsK0708} and \ref {fig:mapsK0925}. We calculate the
integrated observed and intrinsic spectra and compute $A_\lambda$ for this
region. The integrated spectra are shown in the upper panels of the Figures
\ref{fig:extinctionK0708} and \ref{fig:extinctionK0925}, $A_\lambda$ is shown
in the lower panels, along with the fits described below.

Inspecting $A_\lambda$, a ``hump'' in the blue part becomes evident for both
galaxies. This is the biggest question of this report, to which we will go back
later.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figures/spectra_K0708_1.3c_v01.pdf}

\caption{Spectra and extinction of the selected ``dusty'' region in galaxy
K0708, using pipeline 1.3c, and no Voronoi binning. {\em Top}: integrated
intrinsic (blue) and observed (red) spectra.
{\em Bottom}: the measured extinction $A_\lambda$ (black solid line), and
various reddening law fits: \CCM with free $R_V$ (blue solid line) and fixed
$R_V = 3.1$ (blue dotted line); \CAL with free $R_V$ (red solid line) and fixed
$R_V = 4.05$ (red dotted line).}
\label{fig:extinctionK0708}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figures/spectra_K0925_1.3c_v01.pdf}
\caption{The same as Figure \ref{fig:extinctionK0708}, for K0925, pipeline 1.3c, and
no Voronoi binning.}
\label{fig:extinctionK0925}
\end{figure}

Now, we fit a \citet*[hereafter \CCM, blue in the $A_\lambda$
plots]{CCM1989}, and a \citet*[hereafter \CAL, red in the $A_\lambda$
plots]{Calzetti1994} extinction laws to the integrated spectra (lower
panels of the Figures \ref{fig:extinctionK0708} and
\ref{fig:extinctionK0925}). The fits are performed taking only
$\lambda > 4000\,\angstrom$ into account to avoid the weird behaviour
in the blue part, and leaving $R_V$ as either a free parameter or
fixed at $R_V = 3.1$ for \CCM and $R_V = 4.05$ for \CAL. We can
clearly see that for K0708 the ``canonical'' values for $R_V$ fit the
data very poorly for both of laws. The reddening is steeper,
requiring lower values of $R_V$.  Leaving $R_V$ free in this galaxy we
obtain a good fit for both models, perhaps a slightly better result
using \CAL. For K0925, the fits are fairly good regardless of model or
fixing/freeing $R_V$. The parameters obtained are presented in Table
\ref{tab:params}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Fit parameters for \CCM and \CAL reddening laws. The $\star$ symbol
denotes values kept fixed in the fitting process.}
\label{tab:params}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l | r r | r r}
\hline
       & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\CCM} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\CAL} \\
\hline
Galaxy & $R_V$        & $A_V$           & $R_V$        & $A_V$  \\
\hline
K0708  & $1.16$       & $0.13$          & $1.44$       & $0.14$ \\
       & $3.10^\star$ & $0.15$          & $4.05^\star$ & $0.15$ \\
K0925  & $3.91$       & $1.01$          & $3.95$       & $1.01$ \\
       & $3.10^\star$ & $0.98$          & $4.05^\star$ & $1.01$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Next, we compute $A_\lambda$ for each of the spaxels inside the dust lane
(again, the gray region in the maps), and fit a \CCM reddening with $R_V = 3.1$.
The objective is to compare the values of $A_V$ obtained using this method to
the ones given by \starlight, so we must use the same setup. To better compare
the two results, we plot radial profiles of $A_V$ (Figures
\ref{fig:radprofK0708} and \ref{fig:radprofK0925}, top left panels). The radial
profiles were calculated as an average of the $A_V$ in pixels inside a given
radial ring, which may raise some eyebrows. In our defense, radial profiles are
easier to visualize and compare than maps; as this is just a first look into the
subject, we apologize for the lack of rigor.

% *** Natalia: I don't think this tests if the dust screen hypothesis is
% valid. We are testing if a dust screen model with the same intrinsic SSPs might
% be valid, but both things are being tested together and, given the degeneracies
% in age--attenuation, even if we find this model is a good fit this does not mean
% the real world is like this.

In the same Figures we present the average stellar age (top right), $D_n(4000)$
(bottom left), and the flux ratio used in the selection of the dust lane (bottom
right). These were plotted to help assert whether treating the dust lane as a
dust screen is a valid hypothesis\footnote{Other spectral indices could
(should?) also be used.}, but they are surely not enough. We have to find a
suitable way to at least check if the dust lane hypotheis is {\em obviously}
wrong. For now, let's follow the argument using these indices to see what we
get. If the dust lane should contain any embedded or foreground stellar
populations, the radial profiles for mean stellar age and $D_n(4000)$ in the
dust region and in the rest of the galaxy would not match. On the other hand, if
the dust lane really consists of a dust screen, these properties should be the
same in those two regions. The latter is true for $r < 15"$ in the case of K0708
and for $10" < r < 20"$ in the case of K0925. Outside these regions the mean
stellar age and $D_n(4000)$ look quite different. This is probably caused by
wrongly selected regions, including, for instance, contamination near the masked
circle in K0925. Still in K0925, even in the ``good'' section there's a slight
decrease ($\sim 0.2\,dex$) in stellar age, and some variations in $D_n(4000)$.

%TODO: is the decrease enough to discard K0925?
% *** Andre: This has everything to do with Natalia's comment above.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figures/radprof_K0708_1.3c_v01.pdf}

\caption{Radial profiles for galaxy K0708, pipeline 1.3c and no binning. The
solid lines are for the dust region, and the dashed black lines are for the rest
of the galaxy. {\em Top left}: mean $A_V$ obtained by \starlight. In this panel
the dotted points are the $A_V$ obtained by our fitting in the dust region. The
difference between the \starlight and fitted values in the dust region (dashed
red lines) should be equal to the rest of the galaxy (dashed black lines) if
our model is correct. {\em Top right}: mean of the logarithm of stellar age,
weighted by flux. If our model is correct, these should be the same. {\em Bottom
left}: $D_n(4000)$. Again, if our model is correct, these should also be the
same. {\em Bottom right}: flux ratio between $6100$--$6500\,\angstrom$ and
$4000$--$4500\,\angstrom$. This is the main criterion used in the selection of
the dust lane pixels.}
\label{fig:radprofK0708}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{figures/radprof_K0925_1.3c_v01.pdf}

\caption{Same as Figure \ref{fig:radprofK0708} for K0925, pipeline 1.3c, no
binning.}
\label{fig:radprofK0925}
\end{figure}

Now let's examine the $A_V$ radial profiles. The black solid lines are the $A_V$
obtained by \starlight inside the dust lane. If there was no dust lane, the
radial profile of $A_V$ of the galaxy should be the one plotted as dashed black
lines, calculated by masking away the dust lane. The $A_V$ fitted by our model
are plotted as dotted black lines. One would be tempted to compare the values
from \starlight to the ones we fitted, but there's a catch. We measure the
extinction from the dust lane alone, while \starlight measures the extinction of
the dust lane plus the extinction in the underlying galaxy. So, the real
comparison should involve the {\em difference} between \starlight and our model
(plotted as dashed red lines), and the extinction in the underlying galaxy.
Graphically, the red and black lines should coincide. This is certainly not true
for K0708 (top left of Figure \ref{fig:radprofK0708}). Remembering that here we
report \starlight fits using a \CCM law with $R_V = 3.1$, and that K0708 could not be fitted well by this
model, this mismatch is understandable, if not expected. For K0925, fitted
nicely by that law, the red and black lines almost coincide in the $10" < r <
20"$ region. Above this region, there's a weird behaviour in stellar age,
$D_n(4000)$ and $A_V$, probably due to a bad selection of the dust lane, so one
should not expect the lines to match anyway.


\section{Summary and current issues}

The analysis above was performed on datacubes from pipeline 1.3c. We also have
the same plots for pipeline 1.3c (Appendix \ref{sec:app13c}, Figures
\ref{fig:maps_K0708_13c_v20} to \ref{fig:radprof_K0925_13c_v20}) and 1.4
(Appendix \ref{sec:app14}, Figures \ref{fig:maps_K0708_14_v20} to
\ref{fig:radprof_K0925_14_v20}) where we applied a Voronoi binning to achieve
$S/N > 20$. The results are practically the same with those data, which at least
implies that the ``hump'' in the blue end of $A_\lambda$ is not a calibration
issue.

To summarize the findings, questions and possible paths:

\begin{itemize} 

\item We find a ``hump'' in the blue end ($< 4000\,\angstrom$) of the extinction
curve. We are not sure of its origin, or even if it is real or an artifact of
our analysis.

\item We need a more objective way of selecting the dust lane regions.
% Use Lick indices?
% *** Natalia: Which ones? What are we trying to look for?

\item These objects may be in interaction, so the assumption of well--behaved
elliptical shape may not apply. As pointed out by Enrique PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez, the
Figure \ref{fig:sdssK0925_enh} shows what could be a ring around K0925,
indicating that this galaxy could be in interaction.

\item We chose $v_{d,\text{target}} = 300\,\mathrm{km/s}$
  arbitrarily. How do we properly take the velocity dispersion into
  account?

\item Is the dust lane really a dust screen? Does it contain any embedded
stellar populations? This could change drastically the extinction curve.

\item We can feed the intrinsic estimated spectra to \starlight and compare
pixel-wise the stellar populations to the ones obtained using the observed dusty spectra.
Except for $A_V$, all the results obtained should be similar.

\item There's the sodium absorption feature, visible in the lower panel of
Figure \ref{fig:extinctionK0708}. We should try to look at it in higher resolution,
avoiding the velocity convolutions.

\item We should try alternate strategies to determine the intrinsic spectra. For
example, we could fit a lambda-dependant SÃ©rsic profile\footnote{See the
presentation from 6th Busy Week:
\url{ftp://mycalifa:myafi07lAc@ftp.caha.es/documents/6BW/ALdeAmorim_6BW_StellarSynthesis_MorphDecomposition.pdf}.
Also, my qualification exam on morphological decomposition of spectra (in
Portuguese):
\url{http://minerva.ufsc.br/~andre/qualify_2013.pdf}.} after masking away the
dust lane spaxels.
